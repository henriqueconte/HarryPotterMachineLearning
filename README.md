# HarryPotterMachineLearning

Polyjuicer is a fun app that uses machine learning to identify which Harry Potter
Character does someone looks like. After taking a photo or uploading it from your
gallery, the app presents the given character and allows to share the result with your 
friends.

We used CoreML and CreateML to train our models.
